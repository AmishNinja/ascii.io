  <h2>What?</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>ascii.io</strong> lets you record your terminal sessions and share
    them with other geeks simply by running <code>asciiio</code> command in your term.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is fully open-source platform with aim of being a "go to" place for terminal users
    wanting to share their hackery. Web based player is an implementation of VT100/VT102
    ANSI terminal, supporting most ANSI sequences, all text attributes and 256 colors.

    "A picture is worth a thousand words" Fred R. Barnard once said.

  <p>
    Just watch one of the featured asciicasts and see how cool
    <strong>ascii.io</strong> is.

  <h2>Use it</h2>

  <%= markdown do %>
To install or upgrade **ascii.io** recorder, open a terminal and run following command:

    $ curl -sL get.ascii.io | bash

(when using zsh you may need to run `rehash` after above command)

That's it! Now you can start recording your terminal sessions with:

    $ asciiio

If you want your recordings to be assigned to your ascii.io profile (btw, see mine: [~sickill](/~sickill)) run this
and follow instructions:

    $ asciiio auth

See available commands and options with:

    $ asciiio -h
